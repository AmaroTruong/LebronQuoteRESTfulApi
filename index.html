        <h1>Lebron Quote API</h1>
        <p>The Lebron Quote API adheres to the RESTful architecture by treating quotes as resources that can be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP methods. 
            Clients can retrieve quotes by making GET requests to the appropriate endpoints, create new quotes with POST requests, update existing quotes with PUT requests, and delete quotes with DELETE requests. 
            This resource-centric approach ensures that the API follows the principles of statelessness, uniform interface, and scalability, allowing clients to interact with anime quotes in a consistent and efficient manner.</p>
